# Higher-Education-Institutions-in-the-United-States-of-America-Assessment-2023

This repository presents the results obtained from the security assessment of the websites of higher education institutions in the United States of America (USA) in the year 2023 [1]. This data has been published in order to promote open science principles [2]. The data was collected on **(Pendent of confirmation)**.

## Methodology

The database for this research was extracted from the following repository [3]. To analyze this data, a security scanner was used to analyze a set of parameters, namely dnssec, https, axfr and security headers, sharing the results with each institution regarding whether or not each parameter was correct. 

The data obtained was sent to a list of each school informing them of the existence or correct implementation of each checker. This data was then passed to an analyzer [4], which aggregated it to give us a dimension of the implementation of these security requirements in educational institutions in the United States by each state.

The result of this parser generated the files that are at the root of this project.
